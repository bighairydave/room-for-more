Room For More
=============

It's a Wordpress plugin!

Adds a couple of newlines after the &lt;!--more--&gt; tag.l

Description
-----------

If you write posts in Markdown in an external editor such as Marsedit, you may find that the text after your `<!--more-->` tag gets combined into a single paragraph with the 'above the fold' content.

This plugin stops that by adding a couple of newlines after the `<!--more-->` tag at the time the post is saved.

That's it.

Modified from [Breathable More Tag](https://wordpress.org/plugins/breathable-more-tag/).


Installation
------------

1. Upload directory `room-for-more` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. That's it!
